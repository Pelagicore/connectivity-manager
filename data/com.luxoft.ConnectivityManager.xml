      Main interface for Connectivity Manager.

      Used to control and retrieve information of all supported technologies,
      e.g. Wi-Fi connectivity. API goals are ease-of-use and to provide unique
      functionality to be used in an automotive context.

        Connect:

        @input_agent: Object path of UserInputAgent for handling potential input
            requests from user. See com.luxoft.ConnectivityManager.UserInputAgent.

        @object can be a path to:
        - A WiFiAccessPoint. Obtained by introspecting the WiFiAccessPoints
          property.

        Does not return until @object has been connected or an error has
        occurred. Makes it possible for client to know when it can stop
        listening for UserInputAgent requests.

        Since Connect() can involve waiting for user input, a suitable timeout
        that takes this into account should be used for this method call.

        returns. Connection state is always available through some other API.

        RequestCredentials:
        @description_type: Description of type of network request is for. Will
            be one of the following strings:
            - "network"
            - "wireless network"
            - "hidden wireless network"
            If request is shown to user in a translatable UI these strings
            should be mapped to the user's language.
        @description_id: Description identifier of what request is for. E.g.
            this will be an SSID when requesting credentials for a Wi-Fi
            network. Will be an empty string if no suitable identifier can be
            provided.
        @requested: Dict of what is requested, potentially with old values if
            any exist so they can be displayed to user.
        @response: Dict of what user responded, values copied from @requested
            if no response for a particular item.

        @requested and @response are dictionaries. The key in each entry is a
        string that specifies the meaning and type of the value variant
        according to the following:

        "ssid"
            SSID. Value type: ay
            Requested when trying to connect to a hidden Wi-Fi network. Byte
            array since SSID:s are not necessarily in UTF-8.

        "username"
            Username/Identity. Value type: s
            Requested when e.g. connecting to Wi-Fi networks with 802.1x/EAP
            authentication.

        "password"
            Password/Passphrase/Key/Pin. Value type: (ss)
            Requested when connecting to e.g. a secure Wi-Fi network. Value is a
            struct with a string specifying password type, see below, and a
            string with the password itself.

            Password type  Meaning
            "passphrase"   Passphrase (for e.g. 802.1x/EAP authentication).
            "wpa_psk"      WPA PSK
            "wep_key"      WEP key
            "wps_pin       WPS pin

        "password_alternative"
            Password alternative. Value type: (ss)
            Alternative password. See table in "password" for password types.
            Used when e.g. WPS is supported as an alternative choice to WPA. In
            @requested both "password" and "password_alternative" can be
            specified to indicate that there is a choice. In @response only
            "password" should be set to indicate user's choice, password
            alternative will be ignored.

        RequestCredentials() will be called as a result of a client calling
        Connect(). Once Connect() has returned the client can stop exposing the
        UserInputAgent object on the bus. If Connect() returns while a
        RequestCredentials() call is pending, there is no longer any need to
        prompt the user and the return value of RequestCredentials() will be
        ignored.
